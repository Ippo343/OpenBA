// 0x14002ba70 -- NOT a BST helper.  Ghidra's name `MarketWork_helper_ba70` is a
// MISNOMER inherited from the surrounding MarketWork AVL/BST block: the body is a
// fully inlined median-of-three QUICKSORT with an explicit 62-deep work stack and a
// selection-sort cutoff at 8 elements.  It touches no tree node, allocates nothing,
// and calls nothing (verified leaf -- zero CALL instructions in 14002ba70-14002bd74).
//
// It sorts a flat, caller-owned array of 0x18-byte (24-byte) records in place,
// ascending by the SIGNED int32 sort key stored at byte offset +0x08 of each record.
// The remaining 20 bytes of each record are opaque payload and are only ever moved
// as three whole qwords, never interpreted.
//
//   record layout (0x18 bytes, only +0x08 is ever read):
//     +0x00  qword  payload
//     +0x08  int32  SORT KEY  (signed; compared with CMP/JGE/JL)
//     +0x0C  ...    payload
//     +0x10  qword  payload
//
// RELATION TO 0x14002b680 / 0x14002bd80 (ported in a sibling lane): those are the
// SAME sort SHAPE -- median-of-three quicksort, cutoff 8, equal-run collapse, 62-deep
// explicit lo/hi stack -- but a DIFFERENT instantiation.  Do not assume the sibling's
// record parameters here; they were checked and they differ:
//     0x14002b680/bd80 : 0x20-byte records, FLOAT key, compared with COMISS
//     0x14002ba70      : 0x18-byte records, SIGNED INT32 key at +0x08, compared with
//                        CMP/JGE/JL/CMOVL
// This function contains ZERO SSE instructions -- a mnemonic filter for
// COMISS/UCOMISS/COMISD/UCOMISD/MOVSS/MOVSD/ADDSS/MULSS/CVTSI2SS over the whole body
// returns nothing, and no XMM register appears anywhere in the 220 instructions.  So
// the COMISS/NaN porting caveat that applies to the sibling lane does NOT apply here.
// Likewise there is no SHL count-scaling: the count is scaled by the
// LEA [RBX+RBX*2] / LEA [RCX+RBX*8] pair (x3 then x8 = x24).  The only IMULs in the
// body (0x14002bab9, 0x14002bce8, 0x14002bcff) are the /0x18 magic-multiply.
//
// See marketwork_bst_ba70.cpp for the offset-by-offset verification notes.
