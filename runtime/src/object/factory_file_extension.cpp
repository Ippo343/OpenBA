//
// The EIGHTH of this lane's eight bodies, and the one that was never an
// `internal` row at all. Wave 23 lane INTERNAL found that three of the census's
// four `ordinal` gap rows are PHANTOMS — ordinals 443, 3214 and 4462 resolve to
// names that already carry a `ported=1` export row — and that the fourth,
// ordinal 2990, is a REAL row misfiled out of `Object`. This is that row.
//
// Re-derived on this tip rather than quoted:
//
//   tools/runtime_census.py --csv w24.csv
//   awk -F, '$3=="ordinal" && $4=="0"' w24.csv     -> 2990, 3214, 443, 4462
//   standalone/resolve_standalone.cpp:886          -> 2990 is this mangled name
//
// It was reached by ORDINAL from two exe call sites
// (code/Game/Component/buildcomponent.cpp, residencecomponent.cpp) and by
// ADDRESS from nowhere. It IS an export, so it gets a NAME registration — the
// door that survives a rebase and the one the census counts — plus the address
// door, because the mint and the ordinal table both reach it.
//
// EXTENT: 0x1800c04c0..0x1800c0574, 181 bytes, two RET sites (0x1800c0567 for
// the not-found return and 0x1800c0574 for the found return). Bounded by
// Ghidra's function body, NOT by `.pdata` — see the extent note in
// runtime/src/save/saveload_saveinfo.cpp for why `.pdata` is the wrong
// instrument for this question in this binary.
//
// WHAT IT IS: a full IN-ORDER TRAVERSAL of Factory's AVL tree, visiting every
// registered type and `_stricmp`-ing the caller's extension against each
// BaseTypeInfo's `fileExtension` (+0x18). NOT a keyed lookup — the tree is
// keyed by type id, and the extension is not the key, so there is nothing to
// descend on. First match wins; it returns the NODE's key (`*(uint32_t*)node`,
// not `info->typeId`), which the profile build asserts are equal.
//
// A type whose `fileExtension` is null is SKIPPED, not compared: the
// `TEST RCX,RCX / JZ` at 0x1800c04fb jumps to the successor step. Every
// Component/Description registration in the exe passes nullptr there, so on a
// live tree the overwhelming majority of nodes take that arm — which is why
// the effectiveness counter below counts COMPARISONS, not visits.

// That distinction earns its keep here: the decompiler renders the ascent as a

// THE DEAD ARM IS AT 0x1800c0537 and it is a re-test of `p` that 0x1800c0527
// has already proved non-null. It is transcribed as an assertion-shaped
// comment rather than as code, because writing an `if` that can never be true
// is not more faithful — it compiles to nothing and it invites a later reader
// to "fix" the surrounding logic to make it reachable.
//
// THE LAST ARM'S EXIT IS `node = node->parent`, NOT `node = p`. Those differ:
// the loop advances BOTH `node` and `p`, so on exit `node` is the last child
// walked and `node->parent` is its parent — the same value `p` holds only if
// the loop ran at least once and stopped on the `p->right != node` test. When
// the loop stops because `p` went null, `node->parent` is null too and the
// traversal ends. Transcribing `node = p` there would read an already-advanced
// pointer and is exactly the kind of algebraically-plausible substitution that
// hides where terms cancel.
