// runtime/src/object/external_find.cpp — Wave 9 lane RRES, follow-on rung
//   `?Find@ExternalFactory@Object@@AEAAPEAVExternal@2@AEBVFilename@System@@@Z`
//   retail 0x1800be0e0, 165 instructions.
// ============================================================================
//
// The private cache lookup. `FindOrLoad` (0x1800bf320) calls it once, at
// 0x1800bf366, and it is the ONLY caller in the DLL.
//
// WHY THIS ROW IS CHEAP NOW AND WAS NOT BEFORE
//
// Its closure is complete and was completed by two other lanes, not this one:
// `MemFree`, `AdjustDelimiters`, `GetPathIdentifer` and
// `String::operator+(const char*)` were already ours, and `0x18002dd70` — the
// 0x18-element `Collection::Set::Find` this body descends — is lane RES's
// (`runtime/src/object/external_set.cpp`). **Nothing new is opened by this
// file.** That is the whole reason it was picked: WAVE9_LANE_RRES.md §6 named
// it "the cheapest next rung by a wide margin" and this is that rung.
//
// PORTABLE: no <windows.h> (PLAN.md §4.1 decision 1). The detour seam lives in
// `standalone/res_path_detour.cpp` with the one this lane already shipped.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TRAP THIS BODY EXISTS TO EXPLAIN — lane RES's finding, now with its cause
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `WAVE9_LANE_RES.md` §2 recorded that `Find` at `0x18002dd70` **requires a
// delimiter-adjusted key**: a lookup with a raw `/` path silently misses, and
// misses identically in the shipped body, because `Filename`'s copy
// constructor adjusts delimiters on the way INTO the node and nothing adjusts
// the search key. Lane RES paid one run to discover it and wrote that "retail
// guarantees the adjustment at every call site — `ExternalFactory`'s own lookup
// at 0x1800be0e0 calls `AdjustDelimiters` FOUR times before it descends."
//
// This is that function, and the four calls are now accounted for individually.
// They are TWO PAIRS, and each pair is one `Filename x = y` assignment:
// `Filename::operator=` (0x180006770) already ends in `AdjustDelimiters`, and
// retail then calls it AGAIN, explicitly, on the same object:
//
//     0x1800be140 / 0x1800be145   on `key`   after `key = path`
//     0x1800be244 / 0x1800be24d   on `probe` after `probe = key`
//
// So the "four calls" are not four normalisations of four different strings.
// They are two assignments each followed by one redundant re-normalisation, and
// `AdjustDelimiters` is idempotent, so three of the four are no-ops. All four
// are transcribed anyway: the cost is a function call on an already-normalised
// buffer, and dropping them would make this body stop matching the disassembly
// for no benefit.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SECOND COPY IS ALSO REDUNDANT, AND IS ALSO KEPT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `probe` ([RBP+0x30], 0x1800be1fe onward) is a fresh `Filename` that is
// assigned from `key` and then handed to `Set::Find`. `key` was already
// normalised and would have served. Retail builds the copy; so does this port.
// A tidied version would be observably identical and would lose the property
// that makes this file checkable against the listing.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// RETAIL USES ITS CALLER'S SHADOW SPACE AS SCRATCH
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `MOV RBP,RSP` sits after four pushes, so `[RBP+0x20]` is the return address
// and `[RBP+0x28]` / `[RBP+0x30]` / `[RBP+0x38]` — the three `Filename` locals
// — are the CALLER's 32-byte home space. That is legal in the MS x64 ABI and it
// matters for one reason only: when the diff replays the original through the
// detour trampoline, the original scribbles on THIS function's own home space,
// which the compiler has already reserved for the call. Noted because a reader
// checking offsets against the listing will otherwise read `[RBP+0x28]` as an
// argument and it is not one.
