// runtime/src/crt/msvc_libm.h -- Runtime-x64.dll's own math routines, ported
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Runtime-x64.dll statically links the MSVC CRT, so every
// float the shipped engine computes from sqrtf/sinf/cosf/atan2f/powf comes out
// of five specific bodies at five fixed addresses. Our ports were calling
// MinGW/UCRT's libm instead, which disagrees with those bodies in the last bit
// on roughly 0.1-0.2% of ordinary arguments. That is invisible on screen and
// very visible in the Wave 0 diff oracle:
//
//     Math::Vector3::FromYawPitch                 calls=3838   divergences=16
//     Math::Transform::FromYawPitchOffset(...)    calls=45473  divergences=88
//
// Both went silent when routed to the DLL's own CRT, which proved the divergence was
// libm rounding and nothing else -- but that escape hatch calls into the DLL by
// address, so it dies at cutover and takes the fix with it. Porting the five
// bodies fixes the divergence AND removes five ResolveRuntimeRaw dependencies.
//
// These are ordinary functions at known addresses and they are ported the same
// way as anything else in this tree: from the DISASSEMBLY, not from Ghidra's C
// (reference_ghidra_c_output_vs_disassembly.md), with the coefficient tables
// lifted as raw bit patterns by tools/extract_crt_tables.py rather than retyped
// as decimals. The cos series coefficients are NOT the sin ones -- e.g. cos uses
// 0x3f81111111110bb3 where sin uses 0x3f81111111111111 -- which is exactly the
// difference a retyped "1.0/120.0" would erase.
//
//   Retail address   This file
//   0x180128110      Sqrtf   (hardware sqrtss + the CRT's domain-error path)
//   0x180127d90      Sinf
//   0x180126d10      Cosf
//   0x180126680      Atan2f
//   0x180127560      Powf
//   0x180127010      Fmodf   (BATCH 4; only DLL caller is SunLight::GetSunCamera)
//   0x18012a1a4      RemPio2 (Payne-Hanek helper shared by Sinf/Cosf)
//
// FAITHFULNESS BOUNDARY. The retail bodies also call the CRT's error reporting
// (_invalid_parameter / _matherr / errno / feraiseexcept) on domain and range
// errors. Those calls do not change the returned value, and nothing in the game
// reads errno or the FP exception flags, so they are NOT ported; every RETURN
// VALUE is. Each omission is marked with a `// retail: reports <what>` comment
// at the site.
//
// ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE POINT. Floating point is not associative, so these
// bodies transcribe the retail instruction sequence, including temporaries that
// look redundant. Do not "simplify" an expression here; it will change results.
// The build must not contract a multiply-add into an FMA either -- there is a
// static_assert-equivalent #error below, because the project builds for baseline
// x86-64 where no FMA instruction exists.
