//   $ python tools/runtime_census.py --unported --namespace Video
//     Called but not ported (20):
//       12 x ??_7*Data@Video@@6B@   UNPROMOTABLE(NO-OP)   -- not bodies
//        6 x ?_first*/_singleton@   UNPROMOTABLE(HARMFUL) -- not bodies
//        2 x  <-- these
//
// ============================================================================
// THE RETURN IS `System::String` BY VALUE => A HIDDEN RDX RETURN SLOT
// ============================================================================
// `?AV` in `?AVString@System@@` is the by-VALUE spelling. `AEBV` would be
// reference-to-const. The difference is the whole defect class: MSVC returns a
// non-trivially-copyable class through a caller-allocated slot passed in RDX,
// so the real register layout is
//
//     RCX = this, RDX = String* ret, R8D = index
//
// An `fn_*` typedef that omits the slot (`String (*)(void*, int32_t)`) puts the
// index in RDX and returns RAX as if it were the String. It COMPILES, and it
// RETURNS THE RIGHT ANSWER, because RAX comes back holding the slot address
// either way -- while having written 8 bytes through whatever the caller had in
// RDX. That is reference_hidden_retslot_wild_write.md, and it is the trap this
// lane was scoped around.
//
// TWO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATIONS that the slot is real, neither of them "the
// mangling says so":
//   1. The bytes READ RDX three times: `MOV [RSP+0x10],RDX` (spill to home
//      space), `MOV [RDX],R9` (the store), `MOV RAX,RDX` (the return). A body
//      with no return slot never touches RDX.
//   2. Lane IOLANE's discriminator, applied to these two by that lane and by
//      this one independently: "does the body READ RDX at all?" It does.
//      IOLANE's own four bodies do NOT (two are a bare `LEA RAX,[RCX+0x58]`),
//      which is why the hidden-slot half of the shared subject is this lane's
//      alone. Recorded because the kickoff and both briefs described the
//      problem as shared, and MEASURED it is not.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE TWO BODIES DIFFER IN EXACTLY ONE BYTE, PROVED MECHANICALLY
// ============================================================================
// Not read by eye. Both extents are 0x44 bytes, derived independently of
// .pdata (first `CC CC` inter-function padding at +0x44 in both cases, which
// agrees with Ghidra's bound -- two derivations, kickoff warning 16), and
// neither body contains a single rel32 or RIP-relative field, so a RAW byte
// diff is SOUND here rather than reporting the ~23% noise of
// reference_position_only_diffs_hide_one_body.md. The precondition was checked
// by the script, not assumed.
//
//   A GetConstantName 48895424104883ec18...4803 41 30 4c890a488b08...
//   B GetTextureName  48895424104883ec18...4803 41 20 4c890a488b08...
//   differing byte offsets: 1
//     +0x23   A=0x30  B=0x20        <-- the disp8 of ADD RAX,[RCX+disp]
//
// So: SAME CODE over a DIFFERENT MEMBER ARRAY. `_constants` at +0x30,
// `_textures` at +0x20. Any second differing byte would have refuted that, and
// port-by-analogy is only legitimate because the diff was run.

//   18004e4d4: MOV [RDX],R9            ; *** QWORD store of 0, UNCONDITIONAL

//   18004e4e5: MOV [RSP],0x1           ; EH state 1 (not reproduced)
//   18004e4ec: MOV RAX,RDX
//   18004e4ef: ADD RSP,0x18
//   18004e4f3: RET
//
// WRITTEN-OPERAND SET (kickoff §2.2 -- compared as a SET over a derived extent,
// which is how Camera::operator='s byte-vs-dword and EdgeMeshInstance's 1-of-19
// were both caught):
//     [RDX]      QWORD, written TWICE (0 then the pointer)
//     [RCX-0x4]  DWORD, written ONCE and only on the non-null path
// The widths DIFFER, and that is load-bearing in both directions:
//   * writing the refcount as a QWORD would clobber `chars[0..3]` of the
//     string payload, which lives at data+0 immediately after it;
//   * writing the out-slot as a DWORD would leave the high half of the
//     caller's String holding whatever was there before.
// runtime/types/system/String.h already spells the refcount `int32_t` and
// already provides StringRefCount(data) == data[-1] as an int32_t&, derived in
// an earlier wave from different functions. This body agrees with it, which is
// a second derivation rather than a restatement.
//
// THE UNCONDITIONAL `*ret = nullptr` IS NOT DEAD. It is the default-construct
// of the String temporary, and it is what makes the null-name case return the
// EMPTY string rather than leaving the caller's slot untouched. A port that
// only assigned on the non-null path would pass every test whose `ret` happened
// to start zeroed -- which is every test anyone would write by hand. The sweep
// below therefore pre-fills `ret` with a poison value on purpose.
//
// MOVSXD, NOT A ZERO EXTENSION. Ghidra's decompiled C prints a MOVSXD as an
// unsigned widening (reference_ghidra_c_output_vs_disassembly.md), so this is
// read off the DISASSEMBLY. A negative index walks BACKWARD from the array
// base in retail, and does so here. `(uint32_t)index * 16` would read at
// +0xFFFFFFF0 instead of -0x10 -- a 64 GB-away wild read that a non-negative
// sweep can never distinguish. Case 6 of the sweep is exactly that case.
//
// NO NULL CHECK ON `this` OR ON THE ARRAY BASE, and that is transcribed rather
// than "fixed" (CLAUDE.md: retail's unguarded derefs are load-bearing). The
// element's NAME is checked because retail checks it; nothing else is.
//
// ============================================================================
// VERIFICATION: AN INPUT SWEEP AGAINST THE SHIPPED EXPORT
// ============================================================================
// Both bodies are PURE apart from the refcount increment, and every input is
// memory this file can synthesise. So no gameplay route is needed: the sweep
// builds a ShaderProgram-shaped object and real String blocks, runs OURS and
// RETAIL'S on SEPARATE BUT IDENTICAL copies, and compares the full written set
// -- returned pointer, `ret->data`, AND the refcount of every block. That is
// project_pure_functions_verify_by_sweep.md's method, the one that verified
// GetAlignedPosition after it reported calls=0 in a 16.9M-call run.
//
// The retail side goes through the raw DLL door (GetProcAddress), NOT
// ResolveExport, because ResolveExport consults the port registry first and
// would hand back OUR function once registration lands -- turning the oracle
// into a self-check that agrees with itself forever
// (reference_shadow_marker_is_not_an_oracle.md).
//
// There IS a live route as well, and it already exists: Wave 28 lane GFXBODY
// ported `?GetConstantName@Material@Graphics@@` / `?GetTextureName@...`, whose
// whole body is a forwarder onto these two. So these get exercised by anything
// that reads a material's constant names. See this lane's doc for the measured
// attendance and for why GFXBODY's own counter could not be read.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// ENDGAME B.3.5 BLOCK B — THE TWO BODIES MOVED INTO THE MEMBERS, AND THE HIDDEN
// SLOT IS NOW THE LANGUAGE'S
// ============================================================================
// `Video::ShaderProgram::GetTextureName` / `GetConstantName` are members of the
// real class (runtime/types/video/ShaderProgram.h) and RETURN `System::String`
// BY VALUE. GCC's Microsoft-ABI lowering of a by-value class return produces the
// SAME hidden slot in RDX and the SAME `MOV RAX,RDX` that retail's `?AV`
// mangling describes — which is the point of using a real class here (RULE
// B5-12) rather than keeping the slot hand-written forever.
//
// Each registered DOOR keeps its exact three-argument signature — `(self, ret,
// index)`, hidden slot included — so no caller moves, and becomes the
// placement-new form B5-12 prescribes: it constructs the member's PRVALUE
// directly in the caller's slot and returns that pointer. Under C++17 (the
// build's `-std=c++17`) initialising an object from a prvalue of the same type
// is guaranteed elision, so there is NO copy, NO extra refcount bump and NO
// temporary destructor — the member's return object IS the caller's slot. If
// this were C++14 the copy would be a bump-and-release pair that nets to zero
// but is observable to a watchpoint, which is why the standard version matters
// enough to name.
//
// The attendance counters moved INTO the members with the branch they count: a
// hit counter in the door could not see the non-null arm.

//
// It prints even when every counter is 0, deliberately. A report guarded by
// `if (count)` makes "never ran" and "ran and counted zero" the same silence,
