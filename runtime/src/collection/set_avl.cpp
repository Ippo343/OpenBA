// ============================================================================
// runtime/src/collection/set_avl.cpp — Wave 9 lane VID2
//   The four unexported `Collection::Set` AVL bodies that stand between the
//   cutover boot and `Video::Device::PlatformStartup`.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY A COLLECTION FILE IN A VIDEO LANE
// -------------------------------------
// `?PlatformStartup@Device@Video@@AEAA_NXZ` is the next boot wall after the IO
// chain: our ported `Engine::Startup` calls it at
// runtime/src/engine/engine_lifecycle.cpp:719 and a null there returns 0 with
// `g_startupFailAt == 11`. Its last act is to register two USER32 message
// callbacks, and `PlatformShutdown` opens by removing them again. Both are AVL
// operations on the `Collection::Set` rooted at `Application+0x18`, and the
// five helpers underneath were the whole of lane VID2's recorded blocker.
//
// Four of them are here. The fifth — `0x180009c30`, the allocator-lock Free
// wrapper — is already registered (see "THE FIFTH HELPER" below).
//
// THESE FOUR ARE ELEMENT-TYPE-AGNOSTIC, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE HERE AND NOT IN
// runtime/src/application/. They read `_parent` at +0x10, `_left` at +0x18,
// `_right` at +0x20 and the two 16-bit balance words at +0x28/+0x2a, and they
// NEVER touch the element. MSVC emitted one copy for every `Collection::Set`
// instantiation whose node header matches, so a single port at each address
// serves all of them. Nothing here asserts an element size for that reason.
//
// TRANSITIVE CLOSURE, COUNTED BEFORE ANY BODY WAS WRITTEN
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Lane PICK's finding is that porting the visible rows of a census can trade N
// unregistered doors for more than N new ones, so the closure is counted first
// (docs/runtime_port/WAVE9_LANE_PICK.md §2). Counted here:
//
//   0x18000a5b0  node alloc + element copy  -> 0x1800c6e60 (Allocate, REGISTERED)
//   0x18000adc0  AVL retrace                -> 0x18000b040, 0x18000b170
//   0x18000b040  rotate left                -> LEAF, no calls
//   0x18000b170  rotate right               -> LEAF, no calls
//   0x18000aba0  AVL erase                  -> 0x180009c30 (REGISTERED), 0x18000adc0
//
// **The closure is CLOSED at five bodies.** It does not explode the way
// Picking's did: both rotations are leaves (verified with
// `disassemble_function(filter_mnemonics="CALL,RET")` — the only RET, no CALL),
// and the erase and the retrace call only each other and two already-registered
// allocator entry points. `0x18000a5b0` lives with its caller in
// runtime/src/application/message_callbacks.cpp because it is the one
// element-type-SPECIFIC member of the group (it copies 0x10 bytes and allocates
// 0x30).
//
//   doors before this file: 4 unregistered, reached by nothing (no caller yet)
//   doors after:            0 unregistered, reached by the message-callback port
//
// THE FIFTH HELPER — 0x180009c30, AND WHY IT IS NOT REGISTERED HERE
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// It is the allocator-lock Free wrapper and it is **already registered**, with
// a trap worth restating: it takes TWO parameters and IGNORES THE FIRST, so
// registering a one-argument `MemFree` there would free the ignored `this` and
// corrupt the free list. `runtime/src/system/allocator.cpp` registers
// `FreeLockedIgnoringSelf` for exactly that reason.
//
// ⚠ THIS LANE FOUND IT REGISTERED THREE TIMES — and that is now FIXED.
// `allocator.cpp`, `runtime/src/collection/linkedlist.cpp` and
// `runtime/src/io/modification.cpp` each called
// `RegisterRuntimeAddr(0x180009c30, …)` with a different body. The registry's
// last binding wins, so two of the three were dead code and which one survived
// depended on init order — the SHADOWED-registration hazard
// `tools/dispatch_slot_map.py --check` reports for the exe's import table,
// occurring here in the runtime registry where nothing checks for it. All three
// bodies are "Free with an ignored first argument", so nothing was broken; the
// hazard was that a future edit to any one of them would have taken effect, or
// not, depending on link order, silently.
//
// RESOLVED by the integrator: `runtime/src/system/allocator.cpp` is the SINGLE
// owner (the body is an allocator wrapper) and registers it UNCONDITIONALLY from
// `RtSystemPortInit`, outside every wave switch — unconditional because the two
// registrations it replaced were unconditional, and because the door has live
// callers on the DLL-present path as well as at cutover. The other two files
// keep their bodies for their own direct calls and register nothing.
//
// This file relies only on the SHARED contract (ignore arg 1, free arg 2), so it
// was correct before the fix and is correct after it.
//
// ORACLE
// ------
// None of these four can be verified by an ours-then-theirs replay at a live
// call site: every one of them mutates the shared tree, and running the second
// implementation starts from the state the first one left — a different
// experiment whose first product is a corrupted tree. So they are verified by
// the LOCKSTEP SYNTHETIC-SUBJECT PROBE in set_avl_probe.cpp: two private Sets,
// the same script, ours through these bodies and theirs through the shipped
// ones reached via `ResolveRuntimeRaw`, compared **after every step** rather
// than once at the end.
//
// Comparing only at the end is not good enough here and the reason is specific:
// AVL defects CANCEL. A rotation that is wrong in one direction and wrong again
// in the other leaves a tree that is differently shaped in the middle and
// identical at the end, and a single final comparison reports green. The probe
// walks the whole tree in key order after every operation and compares shape,
// balance, height and parent linkage.
