//
// These are the TWO functions Wave 5 lane A explicitly held back
// (runtime/src/achievement/goal.cpp's banner: "the two that move a stream
// cursor ... because no oracle can run both implementations without
// double-consuming the stream"). That reason was correct when it was written
// and is no longer the whole truth: Wave 9 lane S built
// the Wave 9 lane S emission oracle, which replayed a WRITE-path Serialize into two
// INDEPENDENT SYNTHETIC SINKS and compares the emission sequence. A write-path
// Serialize is a pure read of the object, so the replay is legitimate; what
// made it impossible before was the shared stream, not the function.
//
// So this file exists because a blocker dissolved, not because the earlier
// judgement was wrong. goal.cpp's banner is corrected in place (PLAN §6 step 8).
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO CORRECTIONS TO WAVE 9 LANE B'S INVENTORY
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. `wave9_laneB_inventory.csv` lists `Goal::Serialize` as `ghidra-exact, 3`
//    instructions and "likely delegates to a shared base Serialize". It is
//    **33 instructions** and it delegates to nothing: it builds an
//    `IO::Serializer` on its own stack, asks the stream's `IO::Encoding` for a
//    reader or a writer, drives two field serializers, and destroys the codec.
//    A "3-instruction" reading of it would have been ported as a one-line
//    forwarder and silently emitted nothing.
//
// 2. The CSV's callee note claims `GoalInstance::Persist` shares the unnamed
//    internal `FUN_180009d70` with `GoalList::Initialize`, and lane P's brief
//    made "port them together to pay for that dependency once" the reason to
//    pair them. **Persist does not call FUN_180009d70, or FUN_180006d10, or
//    FUN_180009fa0.** Its only direct callee is `FUN_180005dc0`. Read at
//    0x18009ef70 the call list is: two `IO::Encoding` vtable slots (+0x18 /
//    +0x20), `FUN_180005dc0`, one `ReaderWriter` slot (+0x98), and the codec's
//    deleting destructor. The pairing rationale was false; the two functions
//    are paired here only because they are the same shape.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NEW LANE-D ROWS THIS FILE CREATES: TWO, and they are named
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   FUN_1800042a0  — reached by Goal::Serialize     (over Goal+0x20)
//   FUN_180005dc0  — reached by GoalInstance::Persist (over GoalInstance+0x18)
//
// Both are instantiations of the SAME template body — `Object::ExternalBasePtr
// ::Serialize` for two different pointee types; the two decompilations are
// line-for-line identical apart from the `_typeInfo` they compare against.
// Neither appears in `wave9_residue_gameplay.txt` today, so these really are
// two new rows in the hardest bucket, exactly the growth WAVE9.md measured for
// `KeyMap::RegisterInput` (823/504 -> 825/505). They are called BY ADDRESS, the
// way `ClearAll`, `RegisterInput` and `Audio::Scene::Serialize` already call
// `Collection` internals — what is needed from them is the ENTRY POINT, not a
// port. That is a real cost and it is stated rather than hidden.
//
// A CAUTION FOR WHOEVER PORTS THEM, and it is stronger than this comment's own
// first draft said. That draft read "on the READING side (`Encoding` slot +0x10
// returns 3) they call ExternalFactory::FindOrLoad". **That conflated two
// different discriminators and understated the problem.** Reading the whole
// body, there are TWO `FindOrLoad` call sites, selected by two unrelated tests:
//
//   1. `encoding->vtable[+0x10]() == 3` -- NOT "reading". It is a THIRD mode,
//      the resource-reference VISIT pass (WAVE3.md finding 5, IO::VisitorStream
//      / ??_7Visitor@IO@@6B@). It calls GetPath -> FindOrLoad -> IsDerivedFrom
//      and THROWS THE RESULT AWAY; the call is made for its side effect of
//      forcing the referenced resource to be loaded.
//   2. The common tail, guarded by `stream->direction == 0` -- the ORDINARY
//      READING path. This one calls FindOrLoad and **STORES the result into
//      `*param_1`**. It is the actual resolution of the reference, on every
//      save load, not an exotic mode.
//
// So `ExternalFactory::FindOrLoad` -- which WAVE9.md rows 27-28 record as having
// NO POSSIBLE ORACLE, because it rewrites the one shared AVL tree -- is reached
// by the plain load path, and a port of these two internals inherits that
// squarely. It is not a corner.
//
// NONE OF THAT IS REACHABLE UNDER THIS FILE'S OWN ORACLE, which is why the two
// ports below are verifiable and the two internals are not. The lane-S sink
// pins `stream.direction = 1` (writing) and binds all 16 Encoding slots to a
// recording thunk that returns the stub ReaderWriter POINTER -- never 3. Both
// tests therefore fail on both sides of every comparison, and neither
// FindOrLoad site is entered.
//
// THE ONE REPLAY HAZARD ON THE WRITE PATH, checked rather than hedged: that path
// emits `ExternalFactory::GetReferenceId(_singleton, ext)` as a uint. If that
// ASSIGNED an id on first use, replaying would emit N then N+1 and the harness
// would manufacture a divergence it caused itself -- the exact shape of the
// longjmp/dtor defect lane S found in its own prefix stop. It does not:
// `?GetReferenceId@ExternalFactory@Object@@QEBAIPEBVExternal@2@@Z` (0x1800bf100)
// is `QEBA` -- const -- and its body is a pure lookup (build a Filename, find it
// in the map at `this+0x10`, return `[node+0x14]`, else -1). No insert, no
// counter. The write path is idempotent and the replay is sound.
