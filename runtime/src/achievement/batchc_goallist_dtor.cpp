// ============================================================================
//
// The last unported member of Achievement::GoalList. Its behaviour was already
// fully written down — runtime/types/achievement/Goal.h's GoalList banner names
// every step of it as one of the four functions that PIN the layout — and this
// file is that description turned into the body, checked line by line against
// the disassembly at 0x18009f420..0x18009f4cc.
//
//   for (i = 0; i < this->_goals._size; ++i) {     // bound RE-READ each pass
//       slot = &this->_goals._data[i];             // base RE-READ each pass
//       if (*slot) { (*slot)->vtable[0](*slot, 1); *slot = nullptr; }
//   }
//   if (this->_goals._data) MemFree(this->_goals._data);
//   this->_goals._data = nullptr;
//   *(uint64*)&this->_goals._size = 0;             // _size AND _capacity
//
// `vtable[0]` WITH FLAG 1 IS THE SCALAR DELETING DESTRUCTOR: the list OWNS its
// GoalInstances and frees each one — `Object::Destroy(p)`, the virtual
// `delete` (slot 0, flags 1) (Goal.h's slot 0).
//
// THE FREE IS INLINED IN RETAIL as lock / Free / unlock around the allocator's
// +0x640 critical section. goal_list.cpp:194 already records that this triple
// IS `?MemFree@MemoryAllocator@System@@SAXPEAX@Z` (0x1800c7ad0) instruction for
// instruction, and reuses `rtcoll::MemFree` for it; so does this file, for the
// same reason and through the same declaration.
//
// ORACLE: NONE, and it is stated rather than faked. Running the shipped body
// afterwards would call slot 0 with flag 1 on already-freed GoalInstances — a
// double free, not a comparison. the diff oracle records how many calls actually
// had goals to destroy; a GoalList destroyed empty is the common case and
// `calls=` alone would hide that.

// ENDGAME B.3.7: a REAL destructor of the value type (B7-8). The body is the
