// tests/unit/system_abi_stubs.cpp — the out-of-line members the REAL
// `System::Thread` / `System::CriticalSection` own, defined for the host link.
// ENDGAME B.3.4b SYSTEM (2).
// ============================================================================
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A MIRROR
// ------------------------------------------------
// `tests/unit/system_abi_test.cpp` pins the two-slot vtable order by
// constructing a concrete probe subclass of `System::Thread`. Constructing one
// runs the BASE's constructor, which stores the base's vptr — so the link needs
// `vtable for System::Thread`.
//
// GCC emits a class's vtable in the translation unit that defines its KEY
// FUNCTION (the first non-inline, non-pure virtual), and for `System::Thread`
// that is `OnCompleted` — whose real body lives in
// `runtime/src/system/thread_win.cpp`, a file that includes <windows.h> and
// stands on the port registry, so it cannot link into a host test
// (tests/unit/README.md, B31_RULES rule 6).
//
// THE CLASS IS STILL THE REAL ONE. What is defined here is only the BODY of
// each member; the declarations, their ORDER and their signatures come from
// `runtime/types/system/Thread.h`, which is exactly what the test is pinning.
// This file re-declares nothing, so it is the opposite of a mirror — a mirror
// would restate the slots and then test its own copy of the order.
//
// TWO KINDS OF BODY BELOW, and the difference is deliberate:
//
//   * `Thread::OnCompleted` is OBSERVABLE (it bumps a counter). It has to be,
//     because it is the key function AND it is slot 1, and slot 1 is half of
//     what the test measures. Retail's real body is a bare RET (0x18000c590),
//     so the counter is a test double for an empty function and cannot mask a
//     behavioural difference — there is no behaviour to mask.
//   * everything else ABORTS. `Start`, `WaitForFinish` and `ThreadFunc` need
//     live Win32 event HANDLEs and `CriticalSection::Lock`/`Unlock` need an
//     initialised CRITICAL_SECTION; none can run on the host. Aborting means a
//     test that accidentally reaches one fails loudly instead of quietly
//     passing through a stub.
