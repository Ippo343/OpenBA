// src/engine/abi.h -- the data model every pinned layout in the tree assumes, checked once
// (Phase D.4, plans/ABI.md step C.2). Included by global_types.h.
//
// The tree is built by GCC, which lays classes out by the Itanium C++ ABI on every target
// (MinGW-w64 today, Linux x86-64 next). The ~6,900 sizeof / offsetof asserts prove that this
// layout reproduces retail's MSVC offsets; they hold on any target where the facts below hold.
// A pinned layout holds only fixed-width integers, pointers, float / double, bool, enums and
// other pinned classes: never `long` (4 bytes on Win64, 8 on Linux), `wchar_t` (2 / 4), `size_t`,
// a bit-field or a native lock / handle type. `tools/abi_audit.py` enforces that rule.
