// src/platform/win/gfx_win.cpp — the graphics-library seam, Win32 (Phase D.4 RENDER §C.1)
// ============================================================================
// src/platform/common/platform_gfx.h declares the two functions; this file is
// their Windows body. ResolveGfxImport below is devicedata.cpp's helper of the
// same name, MOVED UNCHANGED (body, arguments and the stderr line), with its
// history:
//
// These are the only two non-COM graphics imports VideoDX11-x64.dll has. They
// used to be read out of VideoDX11's OWN import address table (the exact
// pointers the shipped code CALLs through), with GetProcAddress as a fallback.
// Standalone mode made the fallback the only path: the DLL is never loaded, so
// there is no IAT. The order is therefore inverted. LoadLibrary (not
// GetModuleHandle) is what makes this work standalone: with VideoDX11 absent,
// nothing else in the process has pulled d3d11.dll or dxgi.dll in yet, so
// asking for a handle to an already-loaded module returns null and the
// renderer never comes up.
//
// The first argument is the retail IAT slot each entry point was read from
// (VideoDX11 0x180013530 CreateDXGIFactory1, 0x180013520 D3D11CreateDevice).
// It is documentation only and nothing reads it (no door: nothing resolves a
// body by retail address).
