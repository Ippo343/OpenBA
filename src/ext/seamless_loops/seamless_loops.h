// src/ext/seamless_loops/seamless_loops.h -- ext.seamless_loops (block SEAMLESS)
//
// NOT RETAIL. Every looping ambient sound the game ships (Crowd, River, Fire, Rain, Wind, Tornado, the
// biome beds) is xWMA, and the encoder pads the end of the file to a whole WMA frame: the decoded PCM
// ends in 10..45 ms of near-silence (docs/extensions/handins/CHATTER-DIAG.md §3). Retail's XAudio2 and our
// SDL voice both replay a looped buffer whole, so the murmur drops out and slams back in at every wrap.
//
// This extension rewrites the DECODED PCM of a LOOPING buffer once, at load (the user's own installed
// data, transformed in memory; nothing is shipped -- DESIGN.md §3 rule 7):
//   1. trim the codec tail: the trailing run of kTailWindowFrames windows whose RMS is below
//      kTailRatio x the buffer's own quiet level (the kQuietPercentile-th percentile of its 10 ms window
//      RMS), at most kMaxTrimFrames (one WMA frame);
//   2. fold the last kCrossfadeMs into the first kCrossfadeMs with an equal-power crossfade (sin / cos),
//      so the wrap joins the end of the sound to its start; the buffer gets kCrossfadeMs shorter.
// Equal power, not linear: the ambiences are noise-like (uncorrelated between the end and the start), and
// for uncorrelated signals sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 keeps the loudness constant through the fade, where a linear
// fade dips by 3 dB at its middle.
//
// WHERE IT RUNS. `Audio::SoundBuffer::DecodeAtLoad` (src/engine/audio/vtbatch7_soundbuffer_soundeffect.cpp),
// through the engine-side seam `Audio::SoundBuffer::_extLoopSeam` (null by default; DESIGN.md hook rule
// 5), and only when the buffer's own `_loopForever` is set: the loop is a property of the BUFFER
// (SoundBuffer +0x20, serialized before the payload), and the only thing that ever plays a buffer,
// Device::PlayPlatform, takes the loop count from that flag alone, so a looping buffer is never played
// once. The seam is installed at boot (Ext::InitFromSettings) when the row is on; it reads nothing live,
// so a toggle takes effect at the next start of the game.
//
// SAFE FAILURES. A sound whose own quiet level is 0 (>= 1 % of its 10 ms windows digitally silent)
// trims nothing and is only folded; a buffer under 2 x the crossfade, before or after the trim, is left
// exactly as decoded.
//
// Standard C++ only: tests/unit/ext_seamless_loops_test.cpp links this file on its own.
