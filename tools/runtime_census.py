"""Runtime-x64.dll port census: called vs ported vs total, per namespace.

The exe port's progress question was "how many of the addresses our tree asks
for are registered". The runtime port's is the same shape, with three numbers
instead of two:

    total   — functions the DLL actually contains, per namespace
              (from docs/runtime_port/survey_ghidra_census.md, a live Ghidra
              count; this script does not talk to Ghidra)
    called  — the distinct functions OUR tree calls today, i.e. the dependency
              surface we must satisfy before cutover
              (scanned live from code/, engine/, runtime/, standalone/, dx11/)
    ported  — of those, the ones a RegisterRuntimeExport / RegisterRuntimeAddr /
              RegisterRuntimeOrdinal call has taken over

"called" is the honest denominator for the port: it is what has to work for
`reimpl-x64.exe` to boot without the DLL. "total" is the denominator for a
complete DLL reimplementation, which is not the stated goal (PLAN.md §4.1
decision 1: static link, no drop-in DLL).

Usage:
    tools/ghidra_mcp/.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/runtime_census.py
    ... --csv docs/runtime_port/census_<stamp>.csv    write the per-function rows
    ... --unported                                    list what is called but not ported
    ... --namespace UI                                restrict to one namespace

# BLIND SPOT SEVEN (Wave 10 lane CLOSEDLG) -- THE OTHER INSTALLER.
#
# All three regexes above match `InstallRuntimeDetour*`, the relocating front
# doors. The tree has a SECOND installer, `RuntimeDetourInstall` -- the older
# byte-copy one runtime_detour.h calls "deliberately dumb" -- and NOTHING here
# matched it, so every detour installed through it was invisible. Not
# "unresolved and reported": invisible. `nonliteral_detours` came back EMPTY
# while four subjects were detoured, because an unmatched call site is not an
# unresolved one.
#
# That is not a marginal installer. Lane UI1 established that it is the CORRECT
# one for any prologue ending in `MOV RAX,RSP`, because the front doors apply an
# `ADD RAX,8` trampoline fixup ("Bug Class 3") that desynchronises an
# RAX-relative save from an RSP-relative restore. So the census was blind to
# exactly the installer the hardest subjects are obliged to use, and two PORT
# detours were missing from the board:
#
#     0x1801213c0  UI::UserInterface::Update[port]      (lane UI1, five runs)
#     0x180120f20  UI::UserInterface::CloseDialog[port] (lane CLOSEDLG)
#
# The argument order differs -- `RuntimeDetourInstall(addr, wrapper, len, bytes,
# len, "label")` puts the label LAST -- which is why a copy of the pattern above
# would not have worked. The negative lookahead rejects the DEFINITION in
# standalone/filename_runtime_hook.cpp, whose first parameter is a declaration
# (`uintptr_t addr`) rather than an argument; without it the scanner reads a
# function signature as a call site.
#
# The port/instrument split needs no new rule: `_add_detour` already treats an
# UNLABELLED detour as an instrument, which is the right answer for the two
# other users of this installer (`persistobject_probe.cpp` and
# `video_interface.cpp`, both wrappers, neither carrying `[port]`).

    Added 2026-09-06 (Wave 5), because the census had a third blind spot that
    both lane B and lane D hit independently:

        A function our tree reaches only by RAW ADDRESS was bucketed under the
        pseudo-namespace "internal", never into the namespace it belongs to.

    So a namespace row UNDER-COUNTED any class our tree calls by address --
    "Picking 8/8 100%" while a ninth Picking function (RemoveMesh, reached only
    at 0x180125290) sat in the internal bucket -- and, worse, the same function
    could be counted TWICE when one call site used the name and another used
    the address. Both directions corrupt the number this project treats as its
    authority over any agent's "all N ported" claim.

    FAILS LOUDLY if pefile or the DLL is unavailable.

    It used to `return {}` and let the census "degrade to its old address-blind
    behaviour rather than failing". That was wrong, and Wave 9 lane 0 measured
    exactly how wrong: run under the project venv (which has pefile) the census
    reports **830 called / 512 ported**; run under system Python 3.12 (which does
    not) the SAME tree reports **1016 / 616**. Same command, same source, two
    different authorities, no warning either time. It produced a wrong
    intermediate finding inside lane 0's own work (57 phantom "census blind
    spots") before the cause was found.

    That is this project's most-repeated failure mode, and this function was an
    instance of it: `reference_truncated_tool_output_manufactures_calls_zero.md`
    (a `tail -80` faked sixteen sites disappearing) and WAVE9.md's three census
    defects are the same shape -- a tool that answers when it cannot answer. The
    census is the number this project treats as authority over any agent's "all N
    ported" claim, so it must refuse to produce one it cannot stand behind.

    `--allow-degraded` restores the old behaviour for the one case that deserves
    it (a machine with no pefile that only wants the name-keyed rows), and says so
    on stderr every time rather than silently.

    The qualified name is a list of components, inner-to-outer, and the LAST

      * A NAME FRAGMENT is terminated by '@'.

    name whose innermost component is a back-reference ends its scope with a
    SINGLE '@'. `?GetDescription@Achievement@1@QEBA?AVString@System@@XZ` is
    Achievement::Achievement::GetDescription returning a System::String — and

# registration is not a port". And they are not an understated PORT count at
# all: a vtable and a BaseTypeInfo have no body to reimplement, which is the
# whole premise of rt_data_mint.h. The warning was pointing a reader at a
# shortfall that does not exist while saying nothing about the 197 real data
# symbols that are genuinely not live yet.

# So the mint gets its own line, counted from the generated table where every
# symbol IS a literal, and it is kept OUT of the non-literal warning.
