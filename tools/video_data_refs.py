r"""Enumerate every in-DLL reference to the Wave 23 lane VIDVT subjects.

WHAT THIS IS AND WHY IT IS NOT rt_singleton_refs.py
---------------------------------------------------
``tools/rt_singleton_refs.py`` (Wave 15) answers exactly the question rule 6
asks -- "who READS this static in the DLL, in a body we have NOT ported?" -- but
its population is hard-wired to the twenty ``?_singleton@`` rows, and it asserts
that count.  Lane VIDVT's subjects are

  * 4 ``?_first*@`` statics  (heads of intrusive lists of live GPU resources),
  * 12 ``??_7*Data@Video@@6B@`` base vtables (whose triage question is not
    "who reads it" but "who STAMPS it" -- i.e. LEA references),

so this is the same MECHANISM aimed at a different population, with LEA
promoted from a footnote to the headline.  It renders NO verdicts.

METHOD -- deliberately identical to rt_singleton_refs.py's, for comparability
  route SCAN     candidate generation: for every byte offset p in .text and
                 every trailing-immediate size t in {0,1,2,4},
                 base + p + 4 + t + disp32(p) is a candidate target.  No
                 RIP-relative instruction form can escape this; it
                 over-generates, which is the safe direction.
  route BACKWARD confirmation: decode one instruction at every start in
                 [p-15, p-1] with capstone and keep the decode whose own
                 RIP-relative target is the subject.  This is what makes the
                 trailing-imm32 quirk a non-issue (the decoder computes the end
                 of the instruction rather than assuming it) -- see
                 rt_singleton_refs.py's CONTROL 1 negative control, which this
                 tool re-runs as its own control 1.
  route SWEEP    independent linear disassembly of .text, restarting one byte
                 later on an undecodable byte.  Set differences with BACKWARD
                 are printed per row.

A candidate no route can decode is emitted as UNKNOWN-FORM, never dropped: a
dropped reference is a false SAFE.

CONTROLS
  control 1 (positive, borrowed)  the five known ``?_singleton@SaveLoad@Save@@``
      references at their five known VAs, one of which carries a trailing imm32.
      Re-run here because this tool has its own copy of the scan, and a control
      that only ever ran against the OTHER copy proves nothing about this one.
  control 2 (negative)  the same run with candidate generation restricted to
      trailing-imm=0.  It MUST lose the imm32 reference; if it does not, the
      quirk handling is decoration and every count here is suspect.
  control 3 (blind-spot)  a subject address chosen to have NO references
      (a .rdata address in the middle of a string table).  It must report 0,
      which is what distinguishes "this row has no stampers" from "the parser
      is dead" -- the failure recorded in
      reference_absence_screen_must_be_handed_a_shape.md.

PORT STATE of an owning body is read from a runtime_census.py --csv, passed
with --census.  That is screen R1 only; this tool does NOT re-implement screen
R2, and says so in its output rather than implying a two-screen answer.

USAGE
    python tools/video_data_refs.py --census <census.csv>
Needs capstone + pefile: run with the SYSTEM python (the project venv has
pefile but not capstone), exactly as rt_singleton_refs.py requires.
