# tools/game_dir_lock_selftest.sh -- reproduces and verifies the defects fixed
# in tools/game_dir_lock.sh.
#
# Wave 11 follow-ups (2026-09-10):
#   1. empty-ticket starvation in ticket_head()
#   2. a timeout+requeue restamping the ticket epoch, losing FIFO priority
#   3. a caller reading a refusal as a grant (the "exit-code trap")
#
# Wave 26, from Wave 25 lane ALLOC (2026-09-12):
#   4. a LIVE holder expired on the wall clock alone (ALLOC: broken at 1802s
#      with its process alive and a write 1s earlier)
#   5. the holder was never told its lock had been broken
#   6. exe identity across a run was per-lane discipline, not tooling
#
# CONTROLS. Each of 4/5/6 is a screen, and every screen here is handed BOTH a
# shape it must catch and a shape it must not:
#
#   * 4 is scored on a DEAD holder (must break -- otherwise the lock deadlocks
#     forever) and on four separately-evidenced LIVE holders (must not), all at
#     the SAME age. It also asserts the legacy age-only predicate WOULD have
#     broken each live fixture, so a pass cannot come from a fixture that never
#     reached the changed code.
#   * 5 is scored on a breach naming the lane (must shout), on no breach at all
#     (must not -- a banner printed unconditionally is a dead check), and on a
#     breach naming a DIFFERENT lane (must not).
#   * 6 is scored on an exe changed WHILE A RUN IS LIVE (must flag), on an exe
#     changed while idle -- an ordinary deploy (must not), and on an unchanged
#     exe (must not). The corrupted value is the exe bytes, which is exactly
#     what the check compares.
#
# Each defect gets its OWN pass/fail, reported separately -- never an
# aggregate. An aggregate "3/3" cannot distinguish "all three fixed" from "one
# test carrying the others".
#
# Runs entirely against a SCRATCH directory via BANISHED_GAME_DIR. Never runs
# against the real game directory. Uses `GAMELOCK_NO_MAIN=1` to source the
# subject file for its internal functions (ticket_head, ticket_take, ...)
# without triggering its command dispatch.
#
# `acquire`'s exit status is always checked directly ( `if cmd; then` / `cmd;
# rc=$?` ), never through a pipe -- piping the very command whose exit-code
# handling is under test would be its own punchline.

# DEFECT 1 -- empty-ticket starvation
# =============================================================================
# An empty ticket file (asked="") must not make ticket_head() blind to that
# waiter. Reproduce by hand: create a queue dir with two tickets, one of them
# empty and the other with a LATER (larger) asked epoch. The empty one is the
# true earliest waiter (it has been sitting there, we just never recorded
# when) -- what we actually assert is narrower and unambiguous: ticket_head
# must not throw and must not silently skip the file to the point of always
# preferring the other ticket. We assert the two required properties:
#   (a) ticket_head does not error out / abort the loop on an empty ticket
#   (b) an empty ticket IS eligible to be chosen as head (asked coerces to 0,
#       the lowest possible epoch, which is also the conservative choice: an
#       unreadable "when did I ask" defaults to "assume you were first" rather
#       than "assume you don't exist")
