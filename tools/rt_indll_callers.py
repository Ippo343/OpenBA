r"""In-DLL rel32 CALL/JMP scan -- "who still reaches this body WITHOUT a door?"

WAVE 25 LANE DATA.  Written because a DATA row's reader/writer census was about
to produce a WRONG verdict, and this is the half that was missing.

THE QUESTION IT ANSWERS, and why a census cannot
    `tools/runtime_census.py` marks an export `ported` when a DOOR is registered
    for it.  That is not the same as "retail's copy of this function no longer
    runs".  We intercept only at doors, and an in-DLL `rel32` call is not one:
    every call site INSIDE Runtime-x64.dll still lands in retail's body, which
    still touches retail's statics.

    Measured specimen: `?SetText@Error@System@@` and `?Display@Error@System@@`
    are both `ported`, and between them they are the ONLY in-DLL referencers of
    `?_errorString@`, `?_stopApplication@` and `?_hideDisplay@`.  Read from the
    census alone, all three rows look like "every consumer is ours -- promote".
    This tool finds **18** in-DLL rel32 sites reaching retail's `SetText` and
    **2** reaching retail's `Display`.  All three rows are HARMFUL.

WHAT IT EXAMINES
    The `.text` section of `C:\GOG Games\Banished\Runtime-x64.dll`, scanning
    every byte offset for an `E8` (call) or `E9` (jmp) whose rel32 lands on the
    target.  It does NOT see indirect calls through a vtable or a pointer, so a
    `0` means "no DIRECT in-DLL call", never "unreachable".

CONTROL
    Pass a target with known in-DLL callers as the first argument.  A scanner
    that returns 0 for everything is indistinguishable from a true 0 unless it
    is handed a positive shape first
    (reference_absence_screen_must_be_handed_a_shape.md).
    `?StrAppend@String@System@@SAPEADPEADHPEBD@Z=0x1800c9020` is a good one: it
    has exactly one in-DLL caller, inside `?SetText@Error@`.
