r"""Dump a Runtime-x64.dll vtable's slots with their export names. (Wave 20 PROMOTE)

SUBJECT: the SHIPPED bytes of one `.rdata` vtable -- what function does each
slot point at, and is it `_purecall`?  Used to check the premise under the
"nothing can dispatch through this row" claim: a row whose slot 0 is purecall
cannot be dispatched by any correct caller, because retail itself would trap.

Names come from the export table (exact match on the function start) and, where
there is none, from `.pdata` bounds, printed as FUN_<va>.  A slot naming no
known function prints as "(unnamed)" and IS NOT silently dropped.

POSITIVE CONTROL: `_purecall`'s own VA is resolved from the export table first
and printed; if the DLL has no `_purecall` export the tool says so rather than
reporting "0 purecall", which would be a false green.

    # ---- A .pdata RANGE IS A FRAGMENT, NOT A FUNCTION (Wave 21) ----------
    # MSVC chains function fragments through UNW_FLAG_CHAININFO, so a .pdata
    # entry bounds ONE FRAGMENT.  Measured in this DLL by Wave 21 lane CLASS:
    # 932 of 6045 entries (15.4%) carry that flag, covering 116,964 bytes.
    #
    # TWO CONSEQUENCES, and the second is why this note is here:
    #   * END - BEGIN IS A LOWER BOUND ON A FUNCTION'S SIZE, not its size.  Lane
    #     GFXBODY measured AnimationManager::Update at 50 bytes from one record;
    #     it is 430, and 3 of its 13 rows were understated, the worst by 8.6x.
    #   * ATTRIBUTION by raw range names the FRAGMENT's start, which for a
    #     chained fragment is NOT the owning function's entry point.
    #
    # A SIZE-UNDERSTATING blind spot is the opposite polarity from an inflating
    # one: it does not manufacture work, it makes work look CHEAP -- and cheap is
    # what gets picked up without scrutiny.  This tool does NOT follow the chain.
    # It is DECLARED here rather than fixed: correcting attribution would move
    # numbers other lanes are quoting, and lane GFXBODY's corrected method has
    # only 4 of its 13 extents Ghidra-confirmed.  Wave 22 input.
