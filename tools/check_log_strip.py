"""Fail the log-stripped builds BEFORE they break on a qualified `std::printf`.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`make standalone` and `make standalone-perf` both compile with
`-DBANISHED_STRIP_LOGS -include standalone/log_strip.h`, which does:

    #define printf(...) ((void)0)

The preprocessor cannot replace a *qualified* name, so `std::printf(...)` does
not get stripped -- it expands into `std:: ((void)0)(...)` and the translation
unit dies with "expected unqualified-id before '(' token", pointing at
log_strip.h rather than at the offending file. That misdirection is why it takes
a while to diagnose every time.

`log_strip.h`'s own header comment has said "all call sites must use unqualified
`printf`" since it was written. It was still violated twice in two days:

  * Wave 11 follow-up 1 (lane ARM) found `make standalone-perf` had been broken
    for some unknown period -- so `sa-stress` was unrunnable and every "no perf
    regression" claim in that window was never measured on the perf exe.
  * Wave 11 follow-up 2 (lane IOSTREAM) hit it AGAIN one lane later, and four of
    the six offending files were its own.

A rule that lives only in a comment gets broken. This makes it a build gate.

THE COMMENT STRIPPER IS THE POINT
---------------------------------
A naive `grep -rn "std::printf"` reports THREE hits on a clean tree today, and
all three are PROSE -- two in log_strip.h stating the rule, one in
ui_dialog_stub_factories.cpp explaining why the file obeys it. A checker without
a stripper would fail a clean build and send someone to "fix" documentation.
That failure mode is on the record here: a checker with no comment stripper
manufactures work, and its false positives cluster on exactly the comments that
describe the thing it looks for.

So: comments and string literals are removed before matching, and the stripper
carries its own controls (`--self-test`).
