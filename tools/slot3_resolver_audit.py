"""Audit: component vtable slot-3 (stream Serialize) wrappers that never resolve.

THE DEFECT THIS FINDS (closed 2026-09-04 in ParticleComponent, PC_SerSlot3):

  A component's slot-3 body calls the stream through file-static function
  pointers that a lazy `*_InitFuncs()` / `Resolve()` fills in, and every call is
  null-guarded:

      if (s_fn_Component_Serialize) s_fn_Component_Serialize(self, stream);
      if (s_fn_Serializer_Ctor)     s_fn_Serializer_Ctor(ser, stream, 0);
      ...

  On the SAVE leg the component has been alive for thousands of frames, so some
  other slot (Startup / Tick / Event) has long since called the resolver and the
  pointers are live: the body writes its full record.

  On the LOAD leg `InternalFactory::PersistObject` creates the object and
  dispatches vt[0x18] as the VERY FIRST call into the class. If the slot-3
  wrapper does not call the resolver itself, every pointer is null, every
  guarded call is skipped, and the body consumes ZERO bytes -- while the save
  wrote a full record. The stream is then short by exactly that record and every
  object after it deserializes from the wrong offset.

  Symmetric code over asymmetric state. It is SILENT: no crash at the defect, no
  warning, and our own save/load round trip cannot see it, because... it can:
  the two legs are NOT symmetric here, which is why a matched-pair cursor diff
  (BANISHED_SERIALIZE_TRACE=1 on both legs) is what finds it. Diff the per-
  component cursors; the first component whose LOAD delta is smaller than its
  SAVE delta is the culprit.

  The rule this violates is already written down in the tree, above
  code/Game/Component/uicomponent_serialize.cpp's Resolve():
     "Resolved unconditionally at the top of every call -- this can be the very
      first call into the class on load-from-save, so lazy/cached resolution
      elsewhere is not safe."

FIX: one line at the top of the slot-3 wrapper, matching its sibling slots.

      static void Xxx_SerializeVSlot(void* s, void* stream) {
          XxxComponent_InitFuncs();      // slot 3 is the FIRST call into this
                                         // class on a load; without this every
                                         // s_fn_* is null and the body is a no-op
          XxxComponent_Shutdown(reinterpret_cast<XxxComponent*>(s), stream);
      }

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = at least one wrapper reaches a guarded body with no resolver.
